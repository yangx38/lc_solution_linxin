 *
 * Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
 * If version1 > version2 return 1; if version1 < version2 return -1;otherwise
 * return 0.
 * 
 * You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only
 * digits and the . character.
 * The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate
 * number sequences.
 * For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it
 * is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.
 * You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version
 * number to be 0. For example, version number 3.4 has a revision number of 3
 * and 4 for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth
 * level revision number are both 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: version1 = "7.5.2.4", version2 = "7.5.3"
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both “01” and “001" represent the same
 * number “1”
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The first version number does not have a third level revision
 * number, which means its third level revision number is default to "0"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * Version strings are composed of numeric strings separated by dots . and this
 * numeric strings may have leading zeroes. 
 * Version strings do not start or end with dots, and they will not be two
 * consecutive dots.
